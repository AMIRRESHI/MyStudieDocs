teleport concept in vue 3
option api is used to create the project forexample its having methods mount unmount etc

vue 3 introduced compostition api
its concept is similar to react hooks 

in options api data function values are reactive however in composition api values are not reactive however there is a workaround for that.. Refs are used to make it reactive

this keyword is not accessible inside setup method


refs vs reactive:
on refs we need to use the .value property to access it
cant use premivite values with reactives

mutation is syncronous way to update state in store
dont put async code inside the mutations which is using actions
